# Mixed Models (Linear Mixed Models and Generalized Linear Mixed Model)

In this repo I examined how early developmental stages of different populations of a macroalgae responded to the combined effects of environmental stressors, including salinity and aerial and seawater temperature. 

Through this repo you could find different folders which include several statistical analysis using R. This contains two main folders:

1. **Mixed Models** --> this folder contains in turn three subfolders 
   1. Prelimary-Analysis
   2. Main-Analysis
   3. Poststress-Analysis
   4. Field-Analysis 
2. **Species Distribution Models** (Machine Learning Logistic Regression Model)
   1. In progress

# Statistical Analysis using R

In this repo I examined how early developmental stages of different populations of a macroalgae responded to the combined effects of environmental stressors, including salinity and aerial and seawater temperature. 

Experiment schedule:

Through this repo you could find different folders which include several statistical analysis using R. This contains two main folders:

1. **Mixed Models** --> this folder contains in turn three subfolders 
   1. Prelimary-Analysis
   2. Main-Analysis
   3. Poststress-Analysis
   4. Field-Analysis 
2. **Species Distribution Models** (Machine Learning Logistic Regression Model)
   1. In progress

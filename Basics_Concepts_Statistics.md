# When use AIC or AICc

Acording Burnham & Anderson (2002) recommended not to use AIC without the bias correction unless 

N/K < 40

K = total number of parameters of the likelihood
N = sample size

# Normality
In statistics, normality tests are used to determine if a data set is well-modeled by a normal distribution and to compute how likely it is for a random variable underlying the data set to be normally distributed.

# Heterocedasticity

# post-hoc

Post hoc analysis consists of statistical analyses that were specified after the data were seen. This typically creates a multiple testing problem because each potential analysis is effectively a statistical test. Multiple testing procedures are sometimes used to compensate, but that is often difficult or impossible to do precisely. Post hoc analysis that is conducted and interpreted without adequate consideration of this problem is sometimes called data dredging by critics because the statistical associations that it finds are often spurious.


# dispersion

- **Overdispersion** describes the observation that variation is higher than would be expected.

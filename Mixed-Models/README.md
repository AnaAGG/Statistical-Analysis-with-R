# Mixed Model with R

## Intro and Objetive

This repo is the result of a laboratory experiment using two different life stages (germlings and juveniles) of the macroalgae [Fucus_serratus](https://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/detail/1326). 

The seaweed *Fucus serratu* L. is a dominant canopy- forming species on northern Atlantic intertidal shores and its southern limit is in the NW Iberian Peninsula. In the last few decades, the distribution of F. serratus in N Spain has shifted towards the west, and its presence is now almost entirely limited to scattered populations in wave- sheltered Atlantic rias and a few semi-exposed populations in northern Spain, mostly, on the coast of the province of Lugo. Marginal populations from western Atlantic rias and those of N Spain are exposed to contrasting environmental conditions. 

Different environmental factors, such as **water temperature**, **air temperature** and **salinity**, were taken into account in the experiment. The selection of these variables was based on the different environmental conditions to which this species is exposed on the Spanish coast.

The main objetive was evaluate how early developmental stages of different populations of a macroalgae responded to the combined effects of environmental stressors, including salinity and aerial and seawater temperature,to evaluate the possible **local adaptation** of this populations to the current climate change scenario.
